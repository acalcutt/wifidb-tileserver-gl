# TileServer GL
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/maptiler/tileserver-gl.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/maptiler/tileserver-gl)
[![Docker Hub](https://img.shields.io/badge/docker-hub-blue.svg)](https://hub.docker.com/r/maptiler/tileserver-gl/)

Vector and raster maps with GL styles. Server side rendering by Mapbox GL Native. Map tile server for Mapbox GL JS, Android, iOS, Leaflet, OpenLayers, GIS via WMTS, etc.

## Get Started

Make sure you have Node.js version **10** installed (running `node -v` it should output something like `v10.17.0`).

Install `tileserver-gl` with server-side raster rendering of vector tiles with npm

```bash
npm install -g tileserver-gl
```

Now download vector tiles from [OpenMapTiles](https://openmaptiles.org/downloads/).

```bash
curl -o zurich_switzerland.mbtiles https://[GET-YOUR-LINK]/extracts/zurich_switzerland.mbtiles
```

Start `tileserver-gl` with the downloaded vector tiles.

```bash
tileserver-gl zurich_switzerland.mbtiles
```

Alternatively, you can use the `tileserver-gl-light` package instead, which is pure javascript (does not have any native dependencies) and can run anywhere, but does not contain rasterization on the server side made with MapBox GL Native.

## Using Docker

An alternative to npm to start the packed software easier is to install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) on your computer and then run in the directory with the downloaded MBTiles the command:

```bash
docker run --rm -it -v $(pwd):/data -p 8080:80 maptiler/tileserver-gl
```

This will download and start a ready to use container on your computer and the maps are going to be available in webbrowser on localhost:8080.

On laptop you can use [Docker Kitematic](https://kitematic.com/) and search "tileserver-gl" and run it, then drop in the 'data' folder the MBTiles.
